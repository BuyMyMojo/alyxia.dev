# alyxia.dev

Personal website written in ReScript and Next.JS.

The internals of this website are heavily based off of [Rescript's own website](https://github.com/rescript-association/rescript-lang.org/). Lots of stuff taken, I don't feel like crediting them in every file, so I might as well just note it here because it applies to so much.

## TODO

- Leverage Dhall for the navbar, friends page and interop with the resume
- Get rid of all the extraneous Tailwind classes
