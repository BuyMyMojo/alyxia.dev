My grief and sorrow may last through the night,<br />
And I hope, my peace and joy, comes with the morning.<br />
This emptiness in me, that I have to fight,<br />
Fear and depression, please do not define me...

Oh heavens,<br />
Let me believe that all of my life’s not a lie,<br />
Let me seek the path to freedom from my mind.

Just let me dance, oh let me play,<br />
Oh let me cry out all this pain,<br />
Just let me sing 'till I find who am I inside.

**Who am I?**

**Who am I?**

Sing till I find... who am I inside...

My grief,<br />
May last through the night.<br />
Sorrow,<br />
That I have to fight.

**Who am I?**

**Who am I?**

My hurts and wounds may shackle my path,<br />
But these heaven’s wings might lift me from the grounds.<br />
The memories in me, the lies in the past,<br />
Doubts, hesitations, please don't hold me down.
